# Encryption/Decryption Web Application

This is a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using different dictionaries. It also includes light and dark mode options for accessibility, and supports both English and Spanish languages.

## Features

- Encryption: Users can input a message and select a dictionary from a list of available options. The message will then be encrypted using the selected dictionary.
- Decryption: Users can input an encrypted message and select the same dictionary that was used for encryption. The encrypted message will be decrypted to its original form.
- Dictionary Selection: The application allows users to choose from a list of available dictionaries, which determine the mapping of characters for encryption and decryption.
- Light/Dark Mode: The application includes options for light and dark mode, providing accessibility for users with different visual preferences.
- Language Selection: The application supports both English and Spanish languages, allowing users to switch between the two languages for the user interface.
